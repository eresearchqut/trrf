About
-----

The Trial Ready Registry Framework (or TRRF) has been forked from the Rare Disease Registry Framework (or RDRF) by Queensland University of Technology's eResearch team in order to produce a trial ready framework that is fit for purpose across all diseases, with easy deployment, availability and efficient use.

RDRF has been developed at the `Centre for Comparative Genomics <http://ccg.murdoch.edu.au>`_, Murdoch University, Western Australia.

The Rare Disease Registry Framework (RDRF) is an open source tool for the creation of web-based patient registries. What makes it unique is that data entry forms and questionnaires are based on reusable data element definitions (called "Common Data Elements" ) which can be created and/or loaded into the system at runtime. This means that registries can be created and modified without changes to the source code.
