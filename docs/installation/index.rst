Installation
============

We currently install RDRF on CentOS servers which is the supported platform.
There is nothing preventing you to install RDRF on any other Linux distribution, but installing on CentOS is easiest using the RPMs we provide.

Theoretically, you could install on any platform that can run a Python WSGI application. Additionally you will need access to a database server (Postgresql), MongoDB, and Memcached. 

How to install
--------------

In the *how to install* section we assume that you are going to install RDRF on CentOS using our provided RPMs.
